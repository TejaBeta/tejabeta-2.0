# [Tejabeta-2.0](https://www.tejabeta.com).
My website, version 2.0

This project is built using [React](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).<br>

As being a portfolio, things change regularly. I used a method to render all the content from a json file instead of hard coding at places.

## Development
To run a local version of this and do some weird stuff around. Change to project directory and do this.
```
npm start
```

## Technologies
* Hosting -> Google cloud platform
* Docker
* NGINX
* Let's encrypt -> This is a cool free https encryption provider. Please do try this.
